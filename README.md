# ChannelPrediction-andPositioningEnhancement
This dataset consists of two parts:
Two-dimensional elevation maps generated from OSM (OpenStreetMap) maps, which include buildings of the same height and buildings of different heights.
Path loss data labels obtained through raytracing simulation, as well as angle error labels and distance error labels derived from traditional positioning solutions.
